# Matrix-to-Vector Multiplication Leveraging RRAM Crossbar

This repository contains the project Matrix-to-Vector Multiplication Leveraging RRAM Crossbar that I developed for CS248 - Advanced Design of VLSI Circuits and Systems taught by Prof. Gage Hills in the Spring of 2022.

## Milestones
---

### Apr. 24

1. Run through the template files: `dac_controller_digital` and `dac_example`;
2. Schematic + simulation of 3x3 crossbar with resistors, also with 1T1R element.

### May 1

1. Get RRAM circuit model up and running;
2. Schematic + simulation of RRAM crossbar, combining FETs from xr013 PDK and RRAM circuit model.

### May 8

1. Schematic + simulation + layout of crossbar in XFAB PDK, with access to I/O pads or top-layer-metal pads for additional fabrication of RRAM on top;
2. Final write-up.

### Optional

1. Development of control circuitry (DACs, ADCs);
2. Digital control interface + connection to AHB bus;
3. Tape-out.
